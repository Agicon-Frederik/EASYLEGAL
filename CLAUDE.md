# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

EASYLEGAL is an Express.js backend application built with TypeScript.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload (uses nodemon + ts-node)
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory
- `npm start` - Run the compiled production build

## Project Structure

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `src/index.ts` - Main application entry point with Express server setup
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint that returns "We are alive"

## Architecture

The application uses a simple Express.js server architecture:
- Express 5.x for HTTP server
- TypeScript for type safety
- Port configurable via `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 3000)
